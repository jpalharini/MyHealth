MyHealth [UNDER CONSTRUCTION]
=============================

My first Android application!

This is my conclusion project for the Informatics Technical Course at Instituto Federal Sul-Rio-Grandense.
It's an Android application, built around knowledge acquired through the course and some research on my own. It implements several platform resources as well as third-party libraries for communication between Android and MySQL (kSOAP2) and for graphs construction (aChartEngine 1.10).
By sharing the code under GNU GPL v3.0 license, I'm allowing other people to share ideas for the progression of the project and, also, given the due credits for my work, use it on their own projects. If you want to make a pull request or fork it, feel free to contact me and we can discuss that, along with some other great ideas!

Let's code the world, together!

PS: most of the code is written in Brazilian Portuguese due to my course's requirements. An English version of the code, with translated variables, classes and application's strings is currently under progress.
