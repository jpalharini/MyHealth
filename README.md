MyHealth [UNDER CONSTRUCTION]
=============================

My first Android application!

This is my ongoing conclusion project for an Informatics Technical Course at Instituto Federal Sul-Rio-Grandense - Campus Sapucaia do Sul.
It's an Android application based on knowledge gathered through the course in general and some research I made on my own. It implements several platform resources as well as third-party libraries for communcation with a MySQL database (kSOAP2) and for graphs construction (aChartEngine 1.10).
By sharing the code under GNU GPL v3.0 license, I'm allowing other people to share ideas for the progression of the project and, also, given the due credits for my work, use it on their own projects. If you want to make a pull request or fork it, feel free to contact me and we can discuss that, along with some other great ideas!

Let's code the world, together!

PS: most of the code is written in Brazilian Portuguese due to my course's requirements. An English version of the code, with translated variables, classes and application's strings is expected to be ready by the beginning of 2015 and will, certainly, enable wider collaboration from around the world.
